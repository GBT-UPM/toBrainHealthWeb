On September 12, the teams from Bioengineering and Telemedicine Centre (GBT) and the Institut Guttmann joined forces for a kickoff meeting. This marked the beginning of a collaborative effort aimed at advancing brain health research. During the meeting, both teams discussed strategies and outlined plans for the upcoming project which will unfold over the next 3 years. The shared enthusiasm and commitment are set to drive meaningful contributions to our understanding of brain health.
