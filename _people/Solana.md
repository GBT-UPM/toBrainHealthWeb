**Javier Solana Sánchez** specialized in biomedical engineering and telemedicine, exploring the application of Information and Communication Technologies to medicine, particularly in neurosciences, cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive assessment, and brain health. His early research involved the development of computerized tasks for cognitive rehabilitation and the creation of an ICT-based tele-rehabilitation platform, Guttmann Neuro Personal Trainer® (GNPT).

During his doctoral research, he focused on enhancing the GNPT platform by introducing the "Intelligent Therapy Assistant," an innovative decision support system. He also developed an advanced monitoring module using eye-tracking techniques to monitor visual attention. After completing his Ph.D., he led the technological aspects of the European Project PERSSILAA, which aimed to detect and prevent frailty in the elderly through personalized ICT-supported services. As a post-doctoral researcher at Institut Guttmann, he contributed to the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI), investigating the determinants of brain health through web-based platforms, mobile technologies, and data mining.

His recent publications center on the role of mobileHealth technologies in enhancing adherence and motivation for multidomain lifestyle interventions and promoting brain resilience. Additionally, he has worked on the improvement of the GNPT® platform, particularly in the development of a cognitive assessment solution known as "Guttmann Cognitest," which guides intervention programs based on cognitive performance.

He is Co-Principal Investigator of subproject 2 and responsible for WP3, in charge of defining and coordinating every task related to implement the interventions, in its different phases. He will also coordinate and lead tasks related to the data-repository definition and procedures for sharing data and knowledge of the project (WP5). He also participates in WP2.
