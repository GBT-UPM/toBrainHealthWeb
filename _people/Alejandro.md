**Alejandro García Rudolph**, an Information Technology engineer, has been a researcher at the Fundación Instituto Guttmann in Barcelona since 2004, actively contributing to over 15 competitive projects at both national (CENIT, Plan Avanza) and European levels (FP7, H2020).

Over the past 5 years (2018-2022), he was involved in developing and executing the European project PRECISE4Q, a collaboration with 11 partners from 7 countries. The project aimed to create predictive simulation models based on multidimensional data to enhance personalized stroke treatment across its four stages: prevention, acute treatment, rehabilitation, and social reintegration. His role primarily focused on rehabilitation and social reintegration phases.

He is the author of numerous publications in scientific journals, specializing in the application of machine learning techniques to a wide range of demographic, clinical, and behavioral data sources within the field of Neurology.
He participates in data analysis tasks, specifically in those related to clustering classification and idenfitication of relevant variables that predict higher adherence of multi-domain interventions (WP1). He also participates in WP2 and WP5.
