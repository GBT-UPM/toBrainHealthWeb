## Who’s Enrique?

**Enrique J. Gómez Aguilera** joined the field of Biomedical Engineering (BME) when he began his studies in Telecommunications Engineering at the ETSI Telecommunications Engineering of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). His first formal activity in this discipline was carried out in 1983 with the creation and direction of the students "IEEE Bioengineering Group" of the IEEE chapter of ETSIT. In 1985 he defended his master's thesis in the field of "Ambulatory monitoring and evaluation of motor response patterns in Parkinson's disease" and in 1988 his Doctoral Thesis entitled "A new methodology for the metabolic control of diabetes".
Since then,all his teaching and research activity has been carried out in the field of Biomedical Engineering. "Visiting Fellow" at "City Univ.-Measurement and Information Institute" (London, 1991), Visitingprofessor at Univ. of Patras (Greece, 1989-1994), Tech. Univ. Of Sczcecin (Poland, 1998-2001) and Univ. of Athens (Greece, since 1990). 
- He is currently Professor of Biomedical Engineering at UPM, Head of the Department of PT and Biomedical Engineering and Director of the GBT Research Center. Senior Researcher at the National Center for Research in Bioengineering, Biomaterial and Nanomedicine of the National Institute of Health and the CTB of the UPM.
- He has developed an intense activity in the promotion and creation of educational programs at BME at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. He is Director of the Master of Science at BME at UPM (since 2006-). He has established several lines of research in Biomedical Engineering at the UPM: Technologies for Diabetes Care, Medical Imaging, and Image-Guided Surgery, and BME in Neurorehabilitation and Brain Health. -Author of 175 journal articles, 22 book chapters and 402 publications in conference proceedings. Principal investigator in 27 Spanish research projects, 20 industry projects and 39 EU research projects, that have led to the achievement of 8,9 million of euros. He has six research recognized stretches (5 for research and 1 for technology transfer).
- Supervisor of 19 doctoral theses and 10 postdoctoral researchers. Among the doctors graduated under his direction: 8 are university professors, 7 senior researchers in universities and 4 in industry. Director of 13 official research grants, and 90 researchers projects.
- President of the Spanish Society of Biomedical Engineering (2020-) and Honorary Life Member (2018) of IFMBE (International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering). He has been president of EIT Health Spain (European Institute of Innovation and Technology in Health) (2019-2021). Founding member of EAMBES (European Alliance of Medical & Biological Engineering Society) and member of the board of directors (2005-2009). He is a member of the Scientific Council of the “Gadea Foundation for Science”.
- The BME Engineering in Neurorehabilitation and Brain Health research line, which includes this project proposal, was initiated by Prof. Gómez together Dr. JM Tormos (Scientic Director of Guttmann hospital) in 2006. Currently, his main research focuses on digital phenotyping biomedical technologies and intelligent predictive models for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases through multi-domain behavioural interventions for health improvement. In the last 15 years, this interdisciplinarity team have developed 10 R&D&i projects (2 national, 5 with industries and 3 EU), 6 doctoral thesis and 1 commercial product.
