## The Project

Welcome to toBrainHealth, where a collaboration between the experts at Guttmann Barcelona and the innovative minds of the Bioengineering and Telemedicine Group at UPM brings you a holistic approach to brain health. Our primary mission is to promote cerebral well-being while striving for the early diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. By harnessing the latest advancements in medical science, we tailor cutting-edge techniques to address each individual's unique health challenges. Our specialized, intensive neurorehabilitation programs are person-centered, aiming to restore, enhance, or compensate for functional deficits arising from neurological injuries. At toBrainHealth, we are committed to delivering the highest standard of care for your brain health journey.

## Work plan

The work plan has been designed based on the specific objectives of the project and the methodology proposed to achieve them. The following Work Packages (WP) have been defined:
- WP0: Management, coordination, and dissemination. It aims to optimize project management and communication, monitor and support the delivery of objectives, ensure effective issue resolution, maintain scientific quality, and disseminate project outcomes widely to stakeholders, including the general population, healthcare providers, and the scientific community.
- WP1: Data analysis and XAI. It aims to apply data analysis and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to understand brain health and adherence to lifestyle interventions. Specific objectives include identifying determinants, predicting adherence, developing a Data Privacy (DP) model, applying XAI for interpretability, and creating a Decision Support System (DSS) for personalized interventions." 
- WP2: Enhanced user experience. The primary aim of this Work Package (WP) is to explore and implement strategies ensuring the acceptance of technological components in the intervention platform and to enhance adherence. Specific objectives include co-designing user interfaces and requirements with end-users for an optimal user experience, crafting personalized gamification strategies aligned with clinical measures and user profiles, and seamlessly integrating gamification elements into the Brain Health (BH) platform.
- WP3: Lifestyles intervention implementation. It is primarily focused on two key objectives: managing and implementing lifestyle interventions and overseeing the deployment, maintenance, and support of all components within the technological platform.
- WP4: Technical and Clinical validation. The main objective of this work package is to carry out the technical and clinical validation of the personalisation methods proposed and developed within the project to increase adherence to lifestyleâ€™s interventions. The tasks will be focused on defining the evaluation protocol, and analyse the results of the different evaluation cycles.
- WP5: Research data management: data repository implementation. The overarching goal is to create a data repository adhering to FAIR principles, offering on-demand research data to the scientific community. Specific objectives include generating comprehensive, machine-readable metadata to describe the data and establishing semi-automatic procedures for sharing both metadata and the data.
